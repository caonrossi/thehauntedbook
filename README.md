Nine Inch Nails album Ghosts I-IV album contains 36 instrumental untitled tracks identified only as a number. It does not have a defined identity, it only leaves its trace of its existence, like a ghost.

Through a spectrogram of every track of the album, the project aims to imprint the ghost images trapped inside every song, concretely witnessing its existence.
Using "noise" function, every spectrogram picture is being deformed, creating mutations 
In seguito, con l’uso della funzione noise, l’immagine di ogni spettrogramma è stata deformata, generating mutations that reflect the variable and fleeting nature of the ghost. 
Then, every album track has been associated to with an ancient object belonging to Freud's collection, creating a parallelism between the ghost images of Ghosts I-IV and those inherent in these objects.  
The noise function has also been applied to the photographs in the collection, treated in black and white, which are thus brought back to a changing and uncertain state, once again phantasmic.

 "Ghosts I – IV" ghosts, now made visible, accompany the ghosts of past narratives, hidden in Freud's collection of ancient statuettes.
