Elementi d'informatica per il design – Elaborato esame Riboli 2019/2020

Nine Inch Nails album Ghosts I-IV album contains 36 instrumental untitled tracks identified only as a number. It does not have a defined identity, it only leaves its trace of its existence, like a ghost.
Through a spectrogram of every track of the album, the project aims to imprint the ghost images trapped inside every song, concretely witnessing its existence.
Using "noise" function, every spectrogram picture is being deformed, generating mutations that reflect the variable and fleeting nature of the ghost. 
The spectrogram is obtained through the manipulation of a source code, treated in black and white and adapted. The length of the spectrogram makes the duration of the traces visible, putting them in relation to each other.
Then, every album track has been associated to with an ancient object belonging to Freud's collection, creating a parallelism between the ghost images of Ghosts I-IV and those inherent in these objects.  
The noise function has also been applied to the photographs in the collection, treated in black and white, which are thus brought back to a changing and uncertain state, once again phantasmic.

 "Ghosts I – IV" ghosts, now made visible, accompany the ghosts of past narratives, hidden in Freud's collection of ancient statues.
